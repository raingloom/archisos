I've thrown together my favourite apps and configs into one Arch Linux ISO, so that should paint you a nice picture of how organized and documented this thing is.

If you'd still like to use it and are not already familiar with Archiso or just Arch Linux in general, go look at their [wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org), because the chances of this getting proper docs is near zero. (unless you seriously wanna use, in which case, put up a new issue in this repo (but i seriously doubt anyone wants this mess))
